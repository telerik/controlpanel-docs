# Welcome Screen and Main View

The main view of the Control Panel is the starting point that lets you navigate to all menus and tools in the application:

* **Telerik & Kendo UI Tools** - contains all products available for installation or update.

* **View all subscriptions** - presents the subscriptions that expire in less than a year or that have expired less than a year ago.

The main view allows navigation to the product families and user subscriptions (if any). Each product family group represents its division products.

## Subscriptions View

The **Subscriptions View** presents the user subscriptions that expire in less than a year or that have expired less than a year ago:

If a product from the Telerik & Kendo UI Tools family is already installed on the machine and there are no expiring or recently expired subscriptions that require the user attention, when the Control Panel is started it will navigate to DevCraft Ultimate family view.

## Licenses 

On the top of the view you will see the products grouped by license: 

* **All** - shows all products without filtering by license 

* **Purchased** - shows all purchased products of the user 

* **Trial** - shows all available trials for the user 

* **Free** - shows all free products 

## Product Details

In the products view the products are sorted in two lists:

* **Installed products** (on the left) 

* **Products available to install** (on the right)
    
In both lists the products are grouped by their type, e.g. UI Controls, Productivity tools and so on. Each product is shown with its name, license and default action. By clicking on the product tile a product details view is shown (see Product Details). The installed products list contains the Beta versions available for installation. A Beta version is visible only if it is the latest version available. 

## Default actions 

![Default Actions Telerik Control Panel](images/default-actions-telerik-control-panel.png)

In the products view,  the products have a default action. For installed products the default action depends on the product license that the current user has and whether the latest available version is installed. For products available for installation the default action is **INSTALL**. The rest of the available actions for each product are available in the Product Details view. 

## Mass actions 

![Mass Actions Telerik Control Panel](images/mass-actions-telerik-control-panel.png)

All **INSTALL** and **UPDATE** default product actions could be selected with a single click by checking the **UPDATE ALL** or the **INSTALL ALL** checkboxes. 

## Blocked products 

![Blocked Products Telerik Control Panel](images/blocked-products-telerik-control-panel.png)

The products that have blocking installation issues are marked with a yellow exclamation mark. You can get further details on the blocking issues by opening the Product Details view.
