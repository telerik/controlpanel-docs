<!-- ## Feature selection 

The Progress Control Panel provides a feature selection option. The editable features include all Visual
Studio integration features for a product (VS2012, VS2013, VS2015, VS2017, VS2019 and VS2022) and the Local Demos feature. You can customize the installation by including and excluding features for each product.

### Default selection

By default, the Progress Control Panel will include the integration feature for the latest Visual Studio
installed on the machine (if VS2012 and later are selected) and will exclude the local demos feature for
all selected products.

Visual Studio integration features for different products and decide whether to install the local demos
for a product or not.
