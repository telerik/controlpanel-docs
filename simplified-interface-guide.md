# Welcome Screen and Main View

The main view of the Control Panel is the starting point that lets you navigate to all menus and tools in the application:

* **Telerik & Kendo UI Tools**—Shows all products available for installation or update.

* **View all subscriptions**—Presents the subscriptions that expire in less than a year or that have expired less than a year ago.

The **Telerik & Kendo UI Tools View** shows the products in two columns:

* Installed products (on the left) 

* Products available to install (on the right)

### Filtering by License

To display only the Telerik & Kendo UI tools with a specific license, use the built-in filters on the top of the window:

* **All**—Shows all products without filtering by license.

* **Purchased**—Shows all products purchased by the user.

* **Trial**—Shows all available products with currently active trials for the user.

* **Free**—Shows all free products.

### Showing the Product Details

To see more information about a specific product or a tool, click the tile with the desired product. This allows you to see the installation state, license, version, online resources, and available actions.

>tip By clicking on an installed product, you will also see the latest beta version (if a beta version is available).

## View Subscriptions

The Subscriptions view displays information about license expiration date. The information is displayed only for those licenses that are about to expire in 15 months or that have expired in the last 15 months. The main purpose of this view is to remind you about expiring licenses and let you renew them:

* If all your licenses are valid and not expiring soon, the subscription tile will not be displayed on the [main view](#welcome-screen-and-main-view) of the Control Panel.
* If you have licenses that are about to expire in 15 months or have already expired, the Subscriptions view is available displays the licenses that you can renew.

You can continue to use the products included in your subscription for as long as you require. Subscription expiry means that you will no longer be issued any product updates or new product releases. It is possible to renew your subscription at a lower cost than buying a new license. Early Renewals offer the best value, and must be purchased before your subscription expires. Standard Renewals can be purchased up to 60 days after expiry. Welcome Back Renewals are available more than 60 days after expiry.
Every subscription which is covered by the "Renewal" subscription classifier has a "RENEW" action, which opens the generic Telerik renewal page. You can find more detailed information about renewing licenses using the [License-renewals](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/license-renewals) page.

If a product from the Telerik & Kendo UI Tools family is already installed on the machine and there are no expiring or recently expired subscriptions that require the user attention, when the Control Panel is started it will navigate to DevCraft Ultimate family view.

Navigating back, opens the Home page.
