# Updating Telerik Products

To update an installed product through the Progress Control Panel you need to sign in first. After successful authentication you will see the available products for your account, both installed and available to install.

On the left side of the [products view]({%slug simplified-interface-guide%}), select product(s) to be updated by checking the **UPDATE** checkbox of each product. Note that only products that have updates available will have the **UPDATE** option. **UPDATE ALL** option is available too. After you have selected the products to be updated, click **PROCEED**.
